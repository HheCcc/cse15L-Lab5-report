## Part 1 – Debugging Scenario
## Original Post: 
Hello, 
I’m experiencing an issue when trying to reverse an array of integers in Java. 
My method reverseInPlace is supposed to reverse the array in place, but the output isn’t what I expected. Initially, I thought my loop or swap logic might be the issue, but I'm not sure what's wrong.
Here's the part of the code that's giving me trouble:
* Error code

* Error of output
